- [x] Admin dashboard with analytics visualizations

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- [ ] Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API
- [ ] TypeScript for backend development
- [ ] PostgreSQL for primary database
- [ ] Redis for caching and session management
- [ ] Prisma ORM for database interactions

### Blockchain
- [ ] Ethereum for smart contracts
- [ ] Solidity for smart contract development
- [ ] Hardhat for Ethereum development environment
- [ ] IPFS for decentralized storage

### Authentication
- [ ] JWT for secure API authentication
