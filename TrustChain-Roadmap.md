# TrustChain Project Roadmap

## Current State Assessment

- [x] React/TypeScript frontend with UI components
- [x] Simulated authentication system
- [x] Mock drug verification via QR codes
- [x] Supply chain tracking UI
- [x] Admin dashboard with analytics visualizations
- [x] PostgreSQL database initialized and ready

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- [x] Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API
- [x] TypeScript for backend development
- [x] PostgreSQL for primary database (initialized)
- [ ] Redis for caching and session management
- [x] Prisma ORM for database interactions (migrations applied)

### Blockchain

- [ ] Ethereum for smart contracts
- [ ] Solidity for smart contract development
- [ ] Hardhat for Ethereum development environment
- [ ] IPFS for decentralized storageq

### Authentication

- [x] JWT for secure API authentication
- [ ] Web3.js/ethers.js for MetaMask integration
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 for third-party authentication

### DevOps

- [ ] Docker for containerization
- [ ] GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] AWS/Azure for cloud hosting

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation (4 weeks)

- [x] Set up Node.js/Express backend with TypeScript
